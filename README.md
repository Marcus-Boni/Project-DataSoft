## Getting ready 🚀

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

The best way to start with this template is using <code>create-next-app</code>.

npx create-next-app project-name -e https://github.com/Marcus-Boni/Project-DataSoft.git

If you prefer you can clone this repository and run the following commands inside the project folder:

<code>npm install</code> or <code>yarn</code>;
<code>yarn dev</code>;
To view the project open <code>http://localhost:3000</code>.


## Getting Started ✔

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/_app.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
